The first two generations were assembled by Audi's Hungarian subsidiary, one of the world's biggest engine making plants, using bodyshells manufactured and painted at Audi's Ingolstadt plant[1] and parts made entirely by the Hungarian factory for the third generation.</p>
                <p>For each of its three generations, the TT has been available as a 2+2 coupé and as a two-seater roadster based on consecutive generations of Volkswagen's "Group A" platforms, starting with its 'PQ34' fourth generation. Born from this platform, the Audi TT shares powertrain and suspension layouts with its siblings, including the Audi A3, like a transversely mounted front-engine, powering front-wheel drive or four-wheel drive, and fully independent suspension using MacPherson struts in front.</p>
