Originally, it referred to a special chassis for engines more powerful than the usual offering, supplied to a selected number of coachbuilders for the fitting of very light-weight coachwork designed under Rolls-Royce supervision.</p>
                <p>The model name Continental had already been used by Rolls-Royce for models intended and geared for long-distance, high-speed touring on roads and of a style then only available in continental Europe. 1930s to 1950s advertising for even the Standard Steel Bentley saloons carried the slogan the Silent Sports Car.</p>

                <p class="card-text">The Bentley Flying Spur, known as the Bentley Continental Flying Spur before 2013, is a full-sized high-performance luxury saloon produced by Bentley Motors Limited since 2005. It is the four-door grand tourer variant of the Bentley Continental GT coupé.</p>
                <p>The Flying Spur is handcrafted at Bentley's factory in Crewe, England. Each bespoke saloon takes more than 100 hours to assemble completely by hand. Briefly, due to lack of capacity at the Crewe factory upon the car's introduction, 1,358 units of the first generation Flying Spur destined for markets other than the United States and United Kingdom were built at Volkswagen's Transparent Factory in Dresden, Germany. This arrangement ended in early 2007, when all assembly works reverted to Crewe in England.</p>

                <p class="card-text">The Bentley Bentayga is a car produced by British marque Bentley Motors since late 2015. It is the brand's first production SUV, and is considered one of the most luxurious models in that segment.[3][4] Its body is manufactured at the Volkswagen Zwickau-Mosel Plant in Germany, then painted and assembled at Bentley Motor's factory in Crewe, United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>Bentley's first SUV was previewed as the Bentley EXP 9 F concept car at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show. The concept car was based upon the Volkswagen Group MLB platform, powered by a 6.0 L W12 engine producing 600 hp (447 kW).[5] The initial design of the EXP 9 F was redesigned to achieve "more traditional SUV proportions and less retro surfacing."</p>

The Arnage and its Rolls-Royce-branded sibling, the Silver Seraph, were introduced in the spring of 1998. They were the first entirely new designs for the two marques since 1980.</p>
                  <p>The Arnage was powered by a BMW M62 V8 engine, with Cosworth-engineered twin-turbo installation, and the Seraph employed a BMW M73 V12 engine. In September 2008, Bentley announced that production of the model would end during 2009.

The two cars produced were in service for the Queen up until her death in 2022. They have most recently been in service for King Charles III. The Princess Royal used the car while accompanying the Queen's coffin. Both cars are kept in the Royal Mews.</p>
                  <p>The vehicles' twin-turbocharged, 6.75-litre V8 engines have been modified from Bentley's Arnage R version to produce 400 hp (298 kW; 406 PS) and 616 lb⋅ft (835 N⋅m) of torque. Their maximum speed is 130 mph (209 km/h).</p>

                    <p class="card-text">The Bentley Mulsanne is a full-size luxury car that was manufactured by Bentley from 2010 to 2020.[6] The car is named after the Mulsanne Straight of the Le Mans racing circuit, where Bentley have raced many of its cars throughout history. Designed to replace the Rolls-Royce based Arnage, the Mulsanne was the first flagship car to be independently designed by Bentley Motors since W.O. Bentley's 8 litre model in 1930.</p>
                    <p>The Mulsanne nameplate was last used by Bentley for a four-door saloon that was built between 1980 and 1992. It was resurrected as the nameplate for what would become the replacement for the Arnage, Bentley's then flagship model. The new Mulsanne was unveiled at the 2009 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance held on 16 August,[8] followed by the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show,[8] 2010 North American International Auto Show,[9] and the 2012 Qatar Motor Show.</p>
