                <p>The car was launched initially as a 2-door soft-top convertible, with a 2-door fastback coupé version launched in 2013.[5]

                  The F-Type underwent a facelift for the 2021 model year. It was unveiled in December 2019, featuring a significantly restyled front end and dashboard, and simplified drivetrain options.</p>

The XF was available as a four-door saloon and a five-door estate marketed as the Sportbrake. Launched Autumn 2007 as a replacement for the S-Type, the XF was designated internally as the X250.[5] The X250 was succeeded by the X260 in 2015. X250 was the first of the new styled Jaguars.</p>
                <p>The XF was developed at Jaguar's Whitley design and development HQ in Whitley, Coventry and was built at Castle Bromwich Assembly facility in Birmingham.

                  Initially, the XF was planned to use an all aluminium platform but due to time constraints put by Jaguar's board on the development team, the X250 makes use of a heavily modified Ford DEW98 platform.</p>

                  <p>The first generation was marketed as the XK8, replacing the XJS and was Jaguar's first 8-cylinder model since the Daimler 250, introducing the all-new Jaguar AJ-V8 engine. The XK8 shared its platform with the Aston Martin DB7 which was itself based on the stillborn XJ41/42 project built on a modified XJ-S chassis conceived in the mid-1980s. The second generation of the XK, noted for its aluminium monocoque chassis and construction, was launched in 2006 for the 2007 model year.</p>

                    <p>For the most part, they apply present-day technology and materials, with a handful of notable exceptions that utilize novel propulsion and aerodynamic technologies. Their appearance as free update content has been staggered since the launch of GT6 in 2013, with each one being available for download upon release.

                      The cars have been met with critical acclaim for their novel approach to aesthetics and performance. Real-life full-size models have been shown at motor shows in Japan, Canada,[2] Germany, England, the US and Switzerland.</p>
