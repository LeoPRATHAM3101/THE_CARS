The Cayenne shares its platform, body frame, doors and electronics with the similar Volkswagen Touareg and Audi Q7. </p>

It has a rear-mounted flat-six engine and originally a torsion bar suspension. The car has been continuously enhanced through the years but the basic concept has remained unchanged.[1] The engines were air-cooled until the introduction of the 996 series in 1998.</p>
                        <p>The 911 has been raced extensively by private and factory teams, in a variety of classes. It is among the most successful competition cars. In the mid-1970s, the naturally aspirated 911 Carrera RSR won world championship races including Targa Florio and the 24 Hours of Daytona. The 911-derived 935 turbo also won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979.</p>
