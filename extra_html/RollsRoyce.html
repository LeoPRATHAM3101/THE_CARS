It is the eighth and current generation of the Rolls-Royce Phantom, debuting in 2017, and the second launched by Rolls-Royce under BMW ownership. It is offered in two wheelbase lengths. This is the current flagship model made by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.</p>
              <p>It made its public debut at a special exhibition Rolls-Royce held in London two days later on 29 July. The event, dubbed "The Great Eight Phantoms", took place at Bonhams auction house in Mayfair. The exhibition gathered a noteworthy Phantom from each generation, from Fred Astaire's Phantom I to subsequent models driven by royalty, or made famous by celebrities, including John Lennon's Romany gypsy wagon-style painted Phantom V.</p>

              <p>The body style is a two-door pillar-less coupe with suicide doors, where all side windows can roll down like in a convertible. This body style was popular in American cars during the 1950s and 1960s, and was known as the hardtop body style, not used by Rolls-Royce since 1955.</p>
              <p>The Rolls-Royce Wraith was built in order to replace the earlier 2-door car model, the Rolls-Royce Phantom Coupé, built on the basis of the Rolls-Royce Ghost, unlike the earlier model which was based on the 7th Generation Rolls-Royce Phantom, the flagship car model of Rolls-Royce Motor cars until the arrival of the 8th Generation. It is the fastest car made by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.</p>

              <p class="card-text">The Rolls-Royce Ghost is a full-sized luxury car manufactured by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. The "Ghost" nameplate, named in honour of the Silver Ghost, a car first produced in 1906, was announced in April 2009 at the Auto Shanghai show. The production model was officially unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show. The Ghost Extended Wheelbase was introduced in 2011. During development, the Ghost was known as the "RR04". It was designed as a smaller, "more measured, more realistic car" than the Phantom, aiming for a lower price category for Rolls-Royce models.</p>
              <p>According to a statement by BMW AG, this generation of automobile, with an internal combustion engine, is to be produced until 2030, at which point the company intends to manufacture electric models only.</p>

                    <p>At the time of its May 2017 debut at the yearly Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este, it was the most expensive new automobile in the world, costing around £10 million.[4]
